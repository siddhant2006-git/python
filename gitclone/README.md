# PyGit - Command Explanation

This project is a small Python version of Git. It helps you understand how Git-like commands work internally.

## 1. `pygit init`

This command creates a new empty repository.

What happens inside:

- a hidden folder named `.pygit` is created
- `.pygit/HEAD` is created to store the current branch
- `.pygit/refs/heads/main` is created for the `main` branch
- `.pygit/index` is created to store the staging area

Example:

```bash
pygit init
```

Meaning:

- it starts a new Git-like project
- now your folder becomes a repository

## 2. `pygit add .`

This command adds all files from the current folder to the staging area.

What happens inside:

- each file is read from disk
- its content is stored as a blob object
- the object is saved in `.pygit/objects`
- the file path and object hash are saved in `.pygit/index`

Example:

```bash
pygit add .
```

Meaning:

- `.` means all files in the current directory and subdirectories
- the files are prepared to be committed

## 3. `pygit push`

This command sends the branch changes to a remote repository.

In this small project, it is only a simulation. It does not upload real data to GitHub.

Example:

```bash
pygit push origin main
```

Meaning:

- `origin` = remote name
- `main` = branch name

What it does here:

- it prints a message such as "Pushed branch 'main' to remote 'origin'"
- it does not connect to a real server

## 4. Other commands explained

### `pygit commit -m "message"`

This saves the staged files as a new commit.

What happens inside:

- a tree object is created from the staged files
- a commit object is created
- the commit points to the tree and previous commit
- the branch pointer moves to the new commit

### `pygit status`

This shows:

- current branch
- staged files
- untracked files

### `pygit branch`

This creates or lists branches.

### `pygit checkout -b feature`

This creates a new branch and switches to it.

### `pygit merge main`

This merges another branch into the current branch.

### `pygit rebase main`

This moves the current branch changes on top of another branch.

### `pygit push --delete old-branch`

This deletes a branch from the remote.

## 5. How data is stored in this project

This project uses simple Python files and folders to imitate Git.

### Main library files

- `cli.py` -> reads the commands from the terminal
- `repository.py` -> does the main Git-like work
- `models.py` -> defines objects like blob, tree, and commit

### Storage structure

- `.pygit/objects` -> stores all Git-like objects
- `.pygit/index` -> stores staged files as JSON data
- `.pygit/refs/heads` -> stores branch names and commit hashes
- `.pygit/HEAD` -> shows the current branch

### How the data is stored

1. File content is saved as a blob object.
2. A tree object stores the folder structure and file references.
3. A commit object stores a snapshot of the repository.
4. Branch files point to the latest commit.

## 6. Simple example flow

```bash
pygit init
pygit add .
pygit commit -m "first commit"
pygit status
```

This flow means:

- create repository
- add files to staging
- save them as a commit
- check the current state

## 7. How these commands work in a big project

In a big project, these commands are used in the same way, but on a much larger codebase.

### Example workflow

```bash
pygit init
pygit add .
pygit commit -m "Added login feature"
pygit branch feature-login
pygit checkout feature-login
pygit push origin feature-login
```

### What happens in a big project

1. `pygit init` starts the repository for the project.
2. `pygit add .` stages all changed files.
3. `pygit commit -m "..."` saves a complete checkpoint of the project state.
4. `pygit branch` creates a separate branch for new work.
5. `pygit checkout` switches to that branch.
6. `pygit push` uploads the branch changes to a remote server like GitHub.

### Why this is useful

- different developers can work on different features
- code can be reviewed safely
- big projects stay organized
- old versions can be restored if needed

### How data is stored in a big project

A large project stores data in the same way:

- source code files are saved on disk
- staged files are tracked in the index
- commits store snapshots of the project
- branches keep different versions of development
- remotes store the shared copy of the project

## 8. Summary

- `init` starts a repository
- `add .` stages files
- `commit` saves the staged state
- `push` sends changes to a remote
- data is stored using objects, index, refs, and HEAD

This project is made for learning, so it is simple and easy to understand.
